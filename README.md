# sampling-optimization-for-xai
Repository for the BSc. Project titled "Optimizing Sampling Methods for Masking-Based XAI on Time-Series Data using Reinforcement Learning" by Nikolai Bo Enemark Johansen and William Egholm Mistarz.

## Reproduction of Results

For the data used, clone the AudioMNIST repository (https://github.com/soerenab/AudioMNIST), and preprocess it with the corresponding script.

All used parameters are listed in the paper.

Attributions are computed by running the main_attributions script, and are evaluated by running the main_evaluation script.
